    <h2>Existing Members</h2>
    Are you a member looking to register for an RFID card?  If so, you'll want to follow the <%= link_to "Sign Up", new_member_registration_path %>
    link.  As long as the email address that you use to register is the one that you've used in your paypal transaction, you will not have to find
    a member of the hive board to approve your membership.
