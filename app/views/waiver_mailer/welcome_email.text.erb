Welcome to Hive13, <%= @guest.fname %>!

As a gentle reminder, we've emailed a copy of the terms and conditions that you've signed
at the hive.  We want to foster a community where hackers of all stripes can exchange
ideas, skills, and information -- learning from each other as well as teaching.  Thanks
for stopping in and we hope you can become a member soon!

Hive13 is a hackerspace -- and prides itself as being an all inclusive community 
of artists, makers, engineers, programmers, and people who love to learn.  Some 
members come here to work on projects, solicit advice, and invent.  Many others 
just come to socalize and observe.

If you'd like to join, you've taken the first step -- showing up at our space.  If
you are joining us on a night other than Tuesday, you should seriously consider 
swinging by on a Tuesday night:  our meetings are open for all to attend and there 
will always be members and guests willing to show you around and tell you what is
going on in the space.  Members start rolling in after working hours, and are
generally working on projects and/or are open to introductions and general conversation
both before the start of the 7:30 PM meeting, along with usually working on projects
after the conclusion of the metting.  

If you have general questions, please feel free to mail:

hive13help@gmail.com 

Normally, someone will answer your question within a few days.  

Thanks for coming to the hive, and we hope to see you again soon!
